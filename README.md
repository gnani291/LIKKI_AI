🚀 Introducing LIKKI AI Assistant — My all-in-one voice-enabled, multimodal AI system built using Python and Generative AI.
💬 What Can LIKKI Do?
LIKKI is not a basic chatbot. It is a full-featured AI assistant capable of:
✅ Generating responses in TEXT + AUDIO at the same time
 ✅ Understanding voice commands in real-time
 ✅ Performing live web searches
 ✅ Fetching images from the internet
 ✅ Extracting text from uploaded images (OCR)
 ✅ Displaying everything inside a clean Streamlit Web UI
 ✅ Providing smart AI-powered answers
Yes — it can speak + show + search + read images simultaneously ⚡
🧠 How It Works (Tech Stack)
Behind the scenes, LIKKI uses:
🔹 Python (Core Logic)
 🔹 Streamlit (Web Interface)
 🔹 SpeechRecognition + PyAudio (Voice Input)
 🔹 pyttsx3 (AI Voice Output)
 🔹 Generative AI APIs (Smart Responses)

🎯 Why I Built LIKKI?
Because I didn’t want to build another “hello world chatbot”.
I wanted to create:
✔ A real AI product
 ✔ A multi-modal assistant
 ✔ A production-style architecture
 ✔ Something that feels like a real virtual assistant
This project pushed me into AI automation, real-time processing, system integration, and applied Generative AI engineering.
